# Test Vision AI

This project generates white box test cases for applications by analyzing images and optional descriptions. It leverages the power of AI to assist in creating comprehensive test suites.

## Features

- Image-based test case generation
- Optional text description input for enhanced context
- AI-powered analysis using LLaVA v1.5-7b-4096-preview model
- Backend built with Node.js
- Frontend developed in React
- Integration with LangChain and Groq for advanced AI capabilities

## Architecture

The project consists of three main components:

1. Frontend (React):
   - User interface for uploading images and entering descriptions
   - Display of generated test cases

2. Backend (Node.js):
   - API endpoints for receiving image and text inputs
   - Integration with AI models and services

3. AI Model (LLaVA v1.5-7b-4096-preview):
   - Processes image and text inputs
   - Generates relevant white box test cases
## Installation
